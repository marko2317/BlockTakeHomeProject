## What areas of the app did you focus on?
My main focus was having a clean architecture for the project. I decided to use Orbit MVI as the
main architecture.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
Recently I started working with the architecture and I wanted to learn more about it and this project
seems to be a good fit to test my knowledge with it. 

The main problem I was trying to solve is having a clean, scalable and maintainable architecture that
is future prove. 

## How long did you spend on this project?
~5 hours

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
I wanted to add Dependency Injection but didn't had the time to do so. Probably I would include Dagger
or Hilt.
I also didn't implemented the Image caching support within Coil. 

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The UI design
